These are not part of the main export. That way, if you don't use them, they won't increase the size of your bundle.\n\n* [`FluxComponent`](/flummox/api/fluxcomponent)\n* [`fluxMixin`](/flummox/api/fluxmixin)\n\nRefer to the [React integration guide](/flummox/guides/react-integration) for details on how to use FluxComponent and fluxMixin in your application.\n\n```js\nimport fluxMixin from 'flummox/mixin';\nimport FluxComponent from 'flummox/component';\n```\n"}
